# Hotel
I would like to have a database table where I can record all my information of the guest in an organised way.

I am asking the public at large to submit database table scripts to implement this database table.

## spec
The full spec is included in the repo in the file called spec.txt.

## Deliverables
The 3 files listed below are required to implement the requirements for this repo. The info for each one is in the spec.
1. table.sql (create database and table)
2. sampledata.sql
3. reports.sql

## SQL Requirements
- primary key
- properly named columns
- proper data types
- not null as appropriate
- constraints
- files should be able to run repeatedly so include drop and use statements
